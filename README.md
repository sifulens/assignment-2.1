Each time the player guesses, the computer should give the player a hint as to whether the number is too high or too low. The computer should also keep track of the number of guesses. if the number of guesses is larger than 8, the computer will end the game and prompt "Better luck next time". Once the player guesses the correct number, the computer should present the number of guesses and ask if the player would like to play again. (1 for yes or 0 for no)
